    <h1> Assembly of the constructs </h1>

    <p> The team obtained three different FGF constructs from IDT. These contained either the bovine wild-type FGF2 (FGF2 wt), a hyperstable version of the bovine wt FGF2 (FGF2hs) that was designed by the team using mutations described previously [1], or a chimera between the bovine wt FGF-1 and bovine wt FGF2 (FGFC) that was designed by the team based on an earlier publication [2]. All genes were ordered with a thioredoxin tag and a six histidine tag on their 5’ end. The genes came in pUC plasmids. </p>

    <h2>Adding the T7 terminator to the initial FGF2 constructs</h2>

            <p>Since the Biobrick pET vector [3], [4] had its terminator within the SpeI and NdeI cleavage sites, we had to add the T7 terminator and a NdeI cleavage site to the ordered sequence before digesting and ligating it to our vector of choice. This was done by using the same forward primer for all three constructs but a total of three reverse primers (Table 1), since each one was specific for one of the three constructs. <p>

        Adding 6 bp to each restriction site
    </h2>

    <p>After adding the terminator to the three constructs, the team realized that more base pairs were needed to flank the sequences for efficient digestion. The base pairs were added using a single forward primer and three reverse primers, each one of them specific to one of the three constructs (Table 2). Our team planned four different strategies, each one requiring  different primers, as a backup to save time in case something went wrong. Thus a variety of  primers were designed. However, since the reaction of our first strategy for the wildtype was successful (Figure 2), only these corresponding primers were used for the remaining approaches and are showcased in Table 3. </p>

        Double digestion, ligation and transformation
    </h1>

    <p>It was decided that a double digestion would be performed since separate digestion steps resulted in low yields due to many purification steps. We followed NEB’s recommendation on a double digestion with SpeI and NdeI. After digestion, the DNA was purified and concentrated using the Monarch® PCR & DNA Cleanup Kit from NEB. Finally, each of the three constructs was individually ligated to the Biobrick pET plasmid. This was done by using T4 DNA Ligase from NEB while following the manufacturer’s instructions. In the last step, the ligation product was transformed into E. coli Dh5 alpha cells that the team had made competent earlier, see <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Uppsala/Experiments">Protocols</a>. The transformation protocol followed is also described on the <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Uppsala/Experiments">Protocols</a> page. The success of the whole assembly was assessed by colony PCR (Figure 3) and confirmed with sequencing performed by Eurofins.</p>

        Transformation into BL21 (DE3).
    </h2>

    <p>The team spent several weeks trying to get good levels of expression on several brands of E. coli  BL21 (DE3) with different amounts of IPTG but in the end the cells from NEB were the ones that presented positive results so these are the ones that we are going to describe.
    Since the team was able to assemble the construct on the vector, the final step was to transform it into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells for expression. The plasmid was purified using the Monarch® Plasmid Miniprep Kit from NEB following the company’s instructions. The plasmids containing the three genes were transformed into NEB’s competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells using the manufacturer’s instructions. The success of the procedure was assessed by PCR and sequencing (Eurofins) as done in previous transformation steps.</p>

<p>Phosphorylated primers containing the mutations were used for PCR mutagenesis to mutate the FGF2 wt gene. The mutations were L98M, Q54K and V88I. Three separate single mutants (FGF2 L98M, FGF2 Q54K, and FGF2 V88I) were made with PCR and the amplicons contained the entire mutated plasmids and were ligated using T4 DNA ligase. The mutant plasmids were then transformed into E.coli DH5ɑ cells and a colony PCR performed to confirm the PCR (Figure 8). To confirm successful mutagenesis the amplicons were sequenced using Sanger sequencing. One double mutant was also made by repeating the process on Q54K with the L98M primers (FGF2 Q54K+L98M). All plasmids were purified and transformed into E.coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells from NEB. To confirm transformation a colony PCR and gel electrophoresis was performed (Figure 9). </p>

In the next morning, the culture was diluted by taking 2 ml of the overnight and adding it to 100 ml of LB medium supplemented with kanamycin 50 ug/ml. When the cultured achieved an OD600=0.6 the cells were induced using IPTG 1 mM. The cells were incubated at 37 ºC and 220 rpm for 6 hours. Samples of the culture were then analyzed through SDS PAGE (Figure 10-13). </p>

        The clear lysate was purified using a GraviTrap column following the manufacturer’s instructions. The clear lysate and elution samples were analyzed through an SDS PAGE (Figure 7).

The 12% polyacrylamide gel containing the samples was submitted to 200 V and 0.04 A for 90 minutes. The gel was stained with coomassie brilliant blue.

        <p>
            From this initial step used for purification we were able to see that we were able to purify a visible band at around 35 kDa in the lane where the sample that contained FGF2 hs was loaded. We suspect that this band with a higher molecular weight might be due to aggregation of FGFhs with other proteins. However, if this were to be FGF2hs it would be a sign that we would have enough to continue purification with confidence since we had a good amount of this protein even though it was aggregated,
            In the same SDS PAGE we were also able to notice faded bands of FGF2 L98M and FGF wt at around 35 kDa like we see on the FGF2hs lane. This meant that we might have lost some of the protein during the cell lysis step, the several centrifugations, or the nickel column purification that we submitted the sample to. It might also be due to the natural instability seen in FGF2 [5] which could have led to fast degradation of the expressed protein during the time that the team took to purify it.
            No bands of the desired size are visible on the lane where the sample containing FGFC was loaded. We think that loss of protein and its intrinsic instability might be responsible for this.

        <h3>Overexpression in Bioreactor</h3>
        

        <p> Overexpression was performed in 5 L bioreactors (Ez2 controller from Applikon). In order to maintain pH levels and keep foam from forming and clogging the bioreactor inlets, the bioreactor was coupled with a base (25% NH3) so that the solution could be pH regulated during expression and an anti-foam solution. A control tower was connected to the bioreactor to monitor and regulate pH levels and oxygen flow. A vitamin solution, trace A & B solutions and 50µg/ml of kanamycin was added to the bioreactor before inoculation. Approximately 50 mL of overnight culture of E.coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS containing the FGF2 plasmid was inoculated in 2.5 L of cultivation media which gave a final OD600 value of 0.091. See our Lab Notebook on our wiki page for more information on overexpression in the bioreactor, see the <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Uppsala/Experiments">Protocols </a>page.</p>
        
        <p> The OD was measured every 30 minutes to monitor the growth of the bacteria. At OD600 3.12 induction with 1 mM IPTG was performed. Before induction a small sample was collected and kept in 37 °C with 150 rpm shaking as a negative control. After induction OD was measured every hour for three hours (Figure 8). The bioreactor ran for 7.5 h more to a total of 14 h. </p>

        <p>To confirm that FGF2 was overexpressed, a sample from the bioreactor and the negative control was run on an SDS-PAGE gel. A 12% polyacrylamide gel containing the samples was submitted to 200 V and 0.04 A for 90  minutes. A band the size of FGF2 is visible in the induced sample, but not from the uninduced sample, confirming overexpression on a large scale (Figure 15). </p>

        Large Scale Purification
    </h1>
    <p> After confirming overexpression, purification was performed with IMAC using an ÄKTA PURE 125 system. The column was packed with Capto Chelating resin and charged with 0.1 M NiSO4. To remove any unbound nickel, the column was washed with lysis buffer (20 mM TRIS pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2 and 200 mM NaCl). The 2.5 L culture from the bioreactors were spun down for 30 min at 12 000 rpm twice, removing the supernatant in between. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer. To break down the E.coli DNA DNAse was added to the sample before using a french press (EmulsiFlex-C55A from Avestin) to lyse the cells. The sample was run through the french press at 800 bar 3-4 times. The now lysed cells were centrifuged again and the supernatant containing FGF2 was then run through the Ni-charged column. The flow through was collected and the column washed twice, both washes were collected. Elution was collected in fractions as the elution buffer (20 mM tris pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2 and 200 mM NaCl, 500 mM Imidazole pH 7.5) was added with a gradient, slowly increasing the imidazole concentration. This was done since the optimal imidazole concentration for FGF2 elution was unknown. Light absorbance, corresponding to presence of protein, was measured throughout the process to monitor when protein flowed out of the column (Figure 17).

        <p>
             Large amounts of protein was seen in the flow through, and two clear peaks were observed during the second wash when the imidazole concentration was 2%. During the elution there was one clear peak followed by a plateau and this was seen at imidazole concentrations ~140 mM and 220 mM respectively. To analyse in which fractions FGF2 was present, an SDS-PAGE gel was run with flow through, wash 1, wash 2 and fractions B1-C1 (Figure 17). A 12% polyacrylamide gel containing the samples was submitted to 200 V and 0.04 A for 90  minutes.

            No band corresponding to the size of FGF2 was seen in the flow through or the washes. In fractions B1-B3, corresponding to the first peak in the purification, thick bands are visible of ~39 kDa. In fractions B5-C1. corresponding to the shoulder peak, thick bands are visible corresponding to the size of FGF2. The first peak could be a protein with 3-5 His in a row, causing it to bind to the IMAC column, but eluting at a lower imidazole concentration than FGF2, which has 6 His in a row. The gel nonetheless confirms that FGF2 was successfully purified on a large scale.

        Bradford Assay
    </h2>

    <p>
        The fractions containing FGF2 were spin concentrated (Amicon spin concentrators) and the imidazole washed away with a reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2 (pH 8.0)) using the same spin concentrators which were used for protein purification on the small scale. The protein concentration was measured using a Bradford Assay from Bio-Rad [6]. A standard curve was created using BSA. OD595 for the sample was measured and the standard curve used to calculate the amount of expressed protein (Figure 19). The total concentration of FGF2 was 147 mg/mL and the total protein yield from large scale production was 1.6 g of FGF2.

        Future prospects
    </h1>
    <p> 
        After the nickel column purification step the team aimed to cleave the thioredoxin and histidine tags by using enterokinase. This enzyme would cut exactly on the C terminus of each FGF2 variant since we added an enterokinase cleavage site (DDDK) between the tags and the protein. Afterwards, the protein of interest could be separated from the tags in one of two possible ways. The first option would be to use an heparin column since it is known that FGF2 binds heparin [7]. This would then allow us to wash away the tags. The second option would be to use the nickel column again since the His tag, linked to the thioredoxin, would bind the nickel ions in the column and the FGF2 variants could be washed from the column. 
        With the growth factors purified, the team would then be ready to test them on mammalian cell lines to compare their action with the one from commercial FGF2. The team planned to grow bovine aortic endothelial cells, since endothelial cells express FGF receptors and respond well to the presence of FGF [8] and NIH/3T3 cells, since these cells had been used before to compare commercially obtained FGF2 with recombinant FGF2 produced in a research laboratory [9]. The cells would be grown in DMEM supplemented with either commercial FGF2 or one of the FGF2 variants produced by the team. Finally, through an MTT assay, we would be able to show if the cells were growing faster with our enhanced version of the growth factor [9], [10].

                    Since the team focused on making FGF2 more easily produced and more efficient, the proof that these two concepts could be fulfilled had to be obtained through two different projects. One where the team tried to upscale FGF-2 production using our construct in a pET vector in E. coli. One where the purified products of the wild-type FGF-2 protein and other improved variants of this factor were tested on mammalian cells to see how much they would make the cells proliferate when compared to a commercially obtained FGF-2.

                    <h1>Upscaling at Testa Centre</h1>
                    <p>
                    The purpose of the upscaling was to try to see if the expression of the FGF2 variants could be upscaled, which is important for reducing the cost of production.The two strains which had the most promising results (based on results from SDS-PAGE) were wild-type FGF2 and the hyperstable FGF (hsFGF) they were therefore chosen to be upscaled at the large lab facility which was called Testa center.

                    After the cells had reached OD 2.0 they were induced with IPTG and left to grow in the reactor overnight. The following day the cells were then spun down in a centrifuge set to 4 degrees. The pellet was collected from this centrifugation, which had the appearance of a brown paste. This paste was almost entirely E.coli cells which contained FGF2.

                    Unfortunately an SDS-PAGE gel revealed that the strain expressing FGFhs had not produced a protein of a similar size to the desired protein size. However, the results for FGF2 wt did show bands of the right size on the SDS gel. Therefore it was decided that only FGF2 wt would be purified using Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). The culture of the strain expressing FGF2 wt was dissolved in a lysis buffer and lysed in a french press machine. The sample was then spun down and the pellet was thrown away. The FGF2 protein was in the supernatant of the solution as its solubility is increased by the thioredoxin protein. The sample was then applied to the IMAC column, the sample was supposed to bind strongly to the IMAC column as it was designed with 6 residue his tag which should bind strongly to the charged nickel in the column.

                    A concentration gradient of Imidazole was used to elute any proteins which had bound strongly to the column. At a high concentration of imidazole, a protein was eluted indicating  that a protein had bound strongly to the IMAC column. This was done by measuring the absorbance of the sample over time, where the peaks indicated the protein was eluted.

                    The samples which correspond to peaks on the graph were run on an SDS page gel to check if the eluted protein was of the same size as our target protein and this was confirmed as seen in the gels below.

                    <p>
                        Diversity and inclusion are crucial for all sectors of society especially in the field of research and science.Our team itself is diverse with members from eight different countries all over the world.We wanted to explore and represent the world beyond the synthetic biology community,for that, we conducted surveys focused on general public,farmers and interviewed experts from different fields apart from that we engaged with public through our social media posts.

    <h1> Surveys</h1>

    <h2> Cultivated meat general survey</h2>
    
    <p>Farmers would need to be educated towards producing the cultivated meat to allow for a smooth transition and having public's support.</p>
    <p>Cultivated meat will undoubtedly disrupt conventional livestock farming. Provided we can reduce operating costs and educate farmers, to diversify into more sustainable practises, it presents an exciting opportunity to develop sustainable meat production.</p>
    <p>Farmers in the traditional business should have a smooth transition into the cultivated meat process.</p>
    
    
    
    <h2>Farmers Survey</h2>
    <p>
    Farmers are the foundation of any society, providing us with a continuous supply of food. Now, with the increasing global population, new technologies and farming methods will be essential to meet the demand for this inevitable situation we are facing. We therefore wanted to reach out to as many farmers worldwide, to get their opinion on future technologies in farming and the changes they have seen during their time in the trade.In addition, queries and concerns from our public survey on farmers' opinions kindled us to connect with farmers. As a result, we conducted a survey focusing on farmers in collaboration with iGEM Maastricht. The aim of the survey was to gain their perspective on our projects using a brief description in the survey itself. To reach as many as possible, we translated the survey in seven different languages.
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
    So far, we have received replies from three continents and 75% of them are small scale farmers with their main production as crops, poultry and cattle respectively.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the survey. On the scale of 1 to 10, farmers selected 6 to 10 for their view on sustainable food supply. Furthermore 50% of them are open to adapting new technologies in their farm for efficiency and sustainability in the near future.These are ways farmers predict their farms will expand in the near future:farms will expand in future as per their predictions:
    
    ‘We will always seek to improve our sustainability’
    ‘Higher efficiency is sustainable production, less input is needed for the same output.’
    </p>
    
    <br>
    <p>
    Some of the farmers have witnessed few changes including <i>“more efficient and sustainable farming” “Grow as organic as possible and more sustainable products”</i> in their farm which shows their openness to sustainability. Half of them seemed positive about the changes and some commented on the changes that they are expecting.

    <p>
    We questioned the impacts of exciting meat alternatives like plant based meat, mycoprotein on their trade.  For that, 50% disagreed as they believe that meat substitutes do not impact their current trade and 50% of them were unsure.

    <h2>Farmers opinions on our project:</h2>
    
    
    
    ‘I think both projects are worth pursuing, if only to be a launchpad for new, good ideas.’
    ‘Possibly as an integral part. But they require traditional agriculture. Nor do they see how these solutions contribute to biodiversity, healthy soil or happy animals.’
    
    ‘Raw materials are still required to produce plant-based meat and agriculture will continue to require manure (from animals and others) if food is to be sufficient for a growing population on earth.’
    
    ‘Companies that produce cultured meat will be large factory companies that have nothing to do with their environment’

    <h1>Farmers’ Friday</h1>

    <p>
    We constructed a weekly segment on social media called Farmer’s Friday, where we went through different topics regarding traditional farming and how it could be integrated into the conversation surrounding cellular agriculture. Over the course of seven weeks, we hoped to both highlight the opinions of farmers on the topic and to imagine a world in which the two sectors would overlap in one way or another.  We wanted to highlight different ways in which farmers could be affected by changes in their trade in the future. We recognize that one of these changes could become cellular agriculture, so we  researched the possible positive and negative effects to share both sides. We also showcased how collaborations between farmers and cellular agriculture companies have the potential to favor both parties. With this, we wanted to imagine how a future might look for cattle farmers and alternative agriculture. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    We also went over the controversial  debate topic, namely product integrity and if plant based meat should be allowed to be called meat. In 2020, the EU parliament voted for a bill  that let vegetarian and vegan products contain  meat based terms in their names. We also discussed the importance of distinguishing plant-based meat products from regular meat.Our Instagram page was the ideal platform as our followers could take in the information the most immediately. One of the highlights was when we were able to conduct an interview with a local farmer in Sweden to get his perspective on Cellular Agriculture.

    <h1>Promo video multiple languages</h1>

<p>
We are aware of the importance of language to reach out to people. The spoken words in one’s native language can carry out the significance and send the meaning across differently than when you hear it in your second language or reading subtitles. We want science to be reachable to all and spread the word to everyone about cellular agriculture. Since we wanted to reach out to as many as we could, we used our resources within the team to record the promotional video in four different languages.  The iGEM Uppsala team consists of people from many different backgrounds  all over the world. Although we would like to have included every language, we hope that by having the promotional video in Hindi, Swedish,German and English we are able to reach out to many and spread awareness  about the importance of cellular agriculture.

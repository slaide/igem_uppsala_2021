                    <p>Throughout our project we organized many educational sessions for the general public, created educational content that will remain accessible on our youtube channel and social media. We also helped organize a week of synthetic biology experiments for a local high-school class to enable them to get them closer to forming their own team in the future. An exhaustive list of our educational and communications content can be found on our <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Uppsala/Communication">communications page,</a> but since we are going for both the "Education & Communication" gold medal and the “Best Education" award, short summaries of our educational highlights will also be listed here.</p>

                    <p>We organized a two day webinar on the future of farming, link to further reading <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Uppsala/Communication#webinar_link">here.</a> The talks can be found on our youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw_ogArDnpniTuEAEniZhBTOl4Dwxw-Bc">here.</a></p>

                    <p>We helped introduce a local high-school class to synthetic biology and iGEM, to get them closer to starting their own high-school iGEM team, link to further reading <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Uppsala/Communication#hs_visits_link">here.</a></p>

                    <p>We realised during our project that not many people knew about cellular agriculture and cultivated meat, we were also concerned with the impact of cellular agriculture on farming. We started two social media campaigns “CellAg Monday" and “Farmers Friday" in order to bring awareness to these concerns.

                    <p>We also organized an event on prototyping and scaling up for biotechnical products, link to further reading <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Uppsala/Communication#prototyping_event_link">here.</a></p>

                    <p>We presented our project to students interested in joining next year’s iGEM team at the “SynBio Hour", link to further reading <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Uppsala/Communication#prototyping_event_link">here.</a></p>

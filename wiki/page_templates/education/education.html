                        Engaging with the public and our stakeholders has been the cornerstone of our project outside of the lab. Since our project has a wider aim of  improving the current food system, we put emphasis on understanding what effect it could have on both the economy and our environment. We have both looked into the benefits of having cultivated meat on the market and also considered what ethical concerns need to be taken into account. Farmer’s integrity has been important to us and we wanted to know how they can be incorporated in the conversation. To efficiently direct this information, we have approached the general public mainly through our social media. To that end, we started the following initiatives:

                    <h1> Future Farming Webinar </h1>

                    <h2> When you educate one person you can change a life, when you educate many you can change the world”- Shai Reshef </h2> 

                    <p>
                        Our team thought that the best way for us to spread awareness about Cellular Agriculture was by organizing a small conference. The original idea of the 
                        <b> Future Farming webinar conference </b>
                        was to highlight current advances in traditional agriculture and introduce new emerging alternative agriculture, such as cellular agriculture. We wanted to connect this topic of discussion to entrepreneurship, science and sustainability. However, an event requiring the gathering of a large number of people in an enclosed space was still surrounded with scepticism at that time due to the ongoing pandemic. Since we were discouraged from seeing each other in real life, we thought that we should make the most out of the experience of an online event. Therefore, the event was brought to a global audience virtually. We managed to create our dream lineup of nine speakers from three different continents, Europe, America and Australia, and an audience from various different time zones. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>
                        “One great conversation can shift the direction of change forever.”
                        ― Linda Lambert 
                    </h2> 
                    <p>
                        After a full day of formal presentations followed by Q&A, we provided a platform for both our webinar speakers and attendees to interact in a more informal way. We invited all participants to a new online platform called Sophya, a new emerging virtual world where people can assign an avatar to their persona. We encouraged the continuation of interactions there by communicating through pop-up camera windows, similar to Zoom but more interactive. We had embedded interesting articles and websites in the space and even provided some games as ice breakers for attendees. Since this platform is relatively new, and most of the webinar participants were unfamiliar with it, a Sophya guide was created by our team with instructions on how to log in and use the software. The number of people that joined us there was just right for interesting conversations to spark. We had informal discussions with people just like we would at regular physical conferences. Later, we even heard that some people received valuable advice for their iGEM projects. This was a platform where some acquaintances even met and elaborated on their shared interest in alternative proteins. We were thrilled about this addition to our webinar structure and had a lot of interesting interactions with the attendees.

                    <p>
                        DRIVHUSET is a local entrepreneurial innovation hub. In collaboration with DRIVHUSET Uppsala, we set up an interactive

                        </span>
                        for both our team and iGEM Stockholm, where we focused on presenting our project to stakeholders. We had a lecture by Erik Tosterud from DRIVHUSET who showed us how using the Lean Canva model can assist us in setting up a pitch for different stakeholders. After a 30 minute brainstorming session within our teams, we pitched our projects to each other.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The workshop was a unique opportunity for our whole team to sit down together under pressure to get a unified idea of our values and direction for the project. Many ideas emerged during the time, so it was helpful to refer back to our notes later in our project. During this restricted time, we were provided a platform to look at the values surrounding our project and debate what we focus on in outward communication involving our project. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We became better equipped when reaching out to stakeholders, discussing with potential sponsors, in presentations and throughout any discussions surrounding our project in general.

                        <li>How inefficient it is to only eat the meat of animals, when we need to grow additional parts including the bones, intestines or even wings, feathers and more, that are usually not eaten. From a pure production efficiency standpoint, it would be considered wasted resources. With cultivated meat, we could simply grow the muscle and fat tissue needed for the same experience for the taste buds as well as nutritional value </li>
                        <li>How COVID-19 has shown us how zoonotic diseases can spread and cause global pandemics</li>
                        <li>That our early adopters would be most likely be current meat eaters, especially those advocating for sustainability but don’t see a current solution on the market that satisfied their hunger for meat</li>
                        <li>How we would approach farmers differently than other stakeholders, such as the general public open for the idea, cellular agriculture industry members or restaurant chains</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2> SynthEthics Workshop </h2>
                    <p>
                        SynthEthics is a recent start-up that stemmed from former iGEM participants who aim to consider ethical aspects in synthetic biology. In collaboration with iGEM Stockholm, SynthEthics set up an interactive workshop which focused on our two projects specifically and how we could explore ethical aspects within synthetic biology.
                        <br>
                        The two representatives from SynthEthics, the amazing duo Erik and Blanca, had received detailed information about our project and what ethical concerns we wanted to explore. Different ethical considerations came up during the workshop, some of which we had considered before, but their insight also provided us with new perspectives. Our ethical motivations became clearer, so we left the workshop more determined about what we wanted to focus on in our outreach.  
                        <br>
                        For more details on how we explored the ethical aspect of our project, see our <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Uppsala/Human_Practices#ethics">Ethics section</a>.

                    <h1> High School student visits </h1>
                    <p>
                        We were happy to collaborate with the department of Biology Education centre, towards approaching our local NTIG high-school - biotechnology students - early in May, introducing them to synthetic biology and the iGEM competition. Later in August we were visited by the same class of students for a full week of a “synthetic biology workshop”. The class had been interested in synthetic biology and iGEM for some time and this visit served to familiarize the students in this field in more detail. During this week, we therefore gave them an elaborate presentation on our project and explained what our team was specifically designing in the laboratory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the workshop in August, the usage of chromoproteins in visualising expression systems had served as an education piece for the high-school biotechnology students and we were therefore thrilled to be able to integrate such experiments for their laboratory exposure. One of our PIs, Professor Anthony Foster, also gave a lecture on the usage of bio-bricks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For a more practical experience, we helped the students to plan, perform and interpret synthetic biology experiments together with our team members, who tutored the students throughout the process. The students performed transformation of plasmids containing genes from chromoproteins into E. Coli cells and later expressed them. We also taught them some basic microbiological techniques such as, how to pipette, streak bacteria, check the colours of the plates next day and restreak for single colonies.

                        <li>deepen their understanding for possibilities, risks and ethical questions</li>
                        <li>develop their ability to perform theoretical and practical work in biology and to communicate using an appropriate scientific language</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The pupils in the class are all in a natural science specialization in Biotechnology, year 3.<br>
                        The contact with the iGEM2021 team and the faculty supporting the team has been a great inspiration. The generous and knowledgeable support by the iGEM students in the laboratory experiments offered a unique possibility to discuss theoretical and practical perspectives of synthetic biology. The iGEMUppsala 2021 project on cultured meat raised both curiosity, engagement and ethical concerns with the pupils.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The collaboration between the NTI high school and Uppsala University resulted in a new personal network for faculty and students. All parts, lectures, experiments and workshops have been appreciated.”<br>
                        We believe this has given them a much more elaborate view of the possibilities in this field and we believe this workshop as a whole would encourage the students to consider potentially launching a high-school iGEM team in the future.

                    <p>
                        For any synthetic biology project to maximize its impact in the world it has to be taken from the lab out into the real world. Throughout our research during the summer we came into contact with several people within the life-science community with prototyping experience and we decided to give all iGEM teams the opportunity to learn from them by organizing a webinar. Participants got to learn basic prototyping principles from a prototyping expert, received a virtual walkaround at Testa-center, a unique bio-prototyping facility in Uppsala, and heard about the experience of prototyping from a Dutch algae-based startup. We also gave a presentation on our own scale-up efforts planned for the following week.

Our primary educational content has been showcased in a weekly series on our Instagram page known as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CQrLh1gje2n/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">"Cell-Ag Monday"</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CSQHU7pI5z_/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">"Farmer's Friday"</a>, where we discuss a specific topic within cellular agriculture or the farming community for the sake of raising awareness and reaching out in an educative manner.

                    <h2> Cell-Ag Monday </h2>
                    <p>
                        We realised that not many of our followers had previous knowledge about cellular agriculture. In order to spread the word and raise awareness about the field and our research we created a weekly segment called Cell-Ag Monday. Throughout this series we went through different topics regarding cellular agriculture and explained these to educate people about the subject. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first topic introduced what cellular agriculture is, in a short and precise way, so that anyone, no matter the scientific background, would understand the process, while at the same time giving a taste for upcoming topics in the series. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second topic introduced the many benefits that cellular agriculture may offer and how it has the potential to solve issues within public health, human and animal rights and the eminent issue with the environment. In one topic we went through the importance of distinction between plant based meat and cultivated meat and how their processes differ as well their environmental impact and footprint.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next, we gave some insight into cellular agriculture from a global perspective and gave our audience some examples of how startups are forming across the world and the field is expanding. So far, Singapore is the first and only country to date to allow commercial production of cultivated meat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the second season of CellAg Monday we tied back the topics to our project by first highlighting the impact growth factors have on the growth medium and simplifying how we have taken different approaches to enhance the growth factor FGF-2. Lastly we ended the CellAg monday segment by sharing how the iGEM Uppsala team feels about cultivated meat and how our opinions about the subject have changed over the course of our project.

                    <h2> Farmers Friday </h2>
                    <p>
                        Our other weekly segment was called Farmers Friday, where we discussed future prospects of farming and possible problems that might arise with the emergence of alternative farming, such as cellular agriculture. We are aware that farmers are in a difficult position. Demand for meat is increasing and industrial agriculture is pressured to make more food efficiently. All while agriculture bears the high burden of feeding the currently largest ever and growing population. You can read more about how we approached this sensitive topic under inclusivity.

                    <h2> Visibility of our project </h2> 
                    <p>
                        With the help of social media and its affordable wide-spreaded network tools, we focused on improving the visibility of our content. We often used platforms like Global iGEM Slack and the Alternative Protein Slack space to highlight some of our initiatives and for collaborations.
                        <br>
                        By approaching techniques like posting regularly at hours with maximum traffic, using personalised hashtags, presenting our content following a story line etc, we have managed to improve our engagement rate and the number of followers.
                        <br>
                        This enabled us to lay out our project content to a higher number of interested people in a simple way. The picture attached below represents the escalation of the outreach during the time we have conducted our task.

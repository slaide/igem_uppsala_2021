                    <h1> FGF2 variants with increased solubility for easier extraction </h1>

                    <p>
                    FGF2 is an epidermal growth factor with applications in medicine, research and cellular agriculture. We have created a soluble FGF2 biobrick part with flanking restriction sites suitable for insertion in certain pET vectors. FGF2 is most successfully expressed by using inducible expression, and a pET vector is designed so that the FGF2 biobrick part is preceded by an inducible promoter. The FGF2 gene is flanked by the restriction sites NdeI and SpeI which can be cut and inserted into the vector of choice. The solubility is increased with this construct as the FGF2 is attached to thioredoxin, making it easier to extract during purification. This design can be used for successful expression in all of the FGF2 variants, though expression levels may differ. The availability of this part makes modification of FGF2 simpler and easier, and FGF2 can be modified with primer mutagenesis if further modification is required. The construct is annotated in figure 1 below. 
                    </p>

                    An easily expressed soluble FGF2 part can be extremely useful to teams looking to work with epidermal growth factors, especially as cellular agriculture takes off in the coming years. Furthermore, it is also very useful for teams working on tissue engineering for medical applications. Expression of FGF2 can be quite difficult, but with detailed lab notes which we have provided, future teams will not have to waste time trying to express an FGF2 part for their experiment.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The expression has only been tested in 1 vector, i.e. the same pET vector, promoter, RBS and terminator were used for expression of all parts, this is known as the composite construct. Composite parts for all FGF2 variants listed in table 1 are available and all of these were successfully expressed in the lab. The table below shows the basic parts which do not include the pET vector, promoter, RBS or terminator. The basic parts below show include thioredoxin, histidine tag, enterokinase site and the particular FGF-2 variant.

                    <h1>Optimisation of protocol through troubleshooting </h1>

                    <p>
                    Throughout the experimental period, we continued to strive to optimise our procedures as we encountered numerous challenges which are highlighted in <a href=”https://2021.igem.org/Team:Uppsala/Engineeringsuccess”>Engineering success</a>.
                     We have optimised the protocol for future teams to use as a reference when trying to use the part. This notebook guides future iGEM teams on how to express the FGF2 construct, and allows them to avoid mistakes encountered by us. </p>

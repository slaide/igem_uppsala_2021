    When designing the prototype we kept in mind the user and the potential risks leading to releases of the organisms to the environment in mind. Accidents and/or mistakes could happen during the research and development, production, distribution, usage and discard of our biosensor. According to that, we have developed our prototype (see Kit design) and worked accordingly guidelines of our universities regarding safety preconditions in the lab. For our case study ‚ÄúTuberculosis disease‚Äù we have also taken into account possible social concerns and conflicts that could arise upon a stigmatised disease/infection being easily detected (see Human practice).

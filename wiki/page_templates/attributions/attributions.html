                        New Harvest is a non-profit research institute within the field of cellular agriculture. They are true pioneers, being the first organization to support cultivated meat research and are probably still the most influential to date. We want to thank them for their valuable collaboration throughout the summer. Their support was immensely important for our project’s visibility and outreach opportunities.

                        Not only did they support us with a number of connections and expert advice throughout our project, but they also provided support leading up to our <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Uppsala/Communication#webinar_link">Future Farming webinar</a>. Their assistance encouraged us to include a virtual social networking component after presentations for a more informal engagement with the attendees. They introduced us to an amazing new virtual world networking solution called Sophya world. This enabled us to host a social networking event, which would not have been possible without the support from New Harvest.

                                    <p>
                                        Irfan Tahir is a New Harvest research fellow and a PhD student at the Engineered Biomaterials Research Laboratory at the University of Vermont where he is tissue engineering cell-cultured meat on plant-based scaffolds.
                                    </p>
                                <h3>Why</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        While analyzing the cultivated meat production chain, we wanted to hear the opinions from experts who work closely with alternative proteins or cultivated meat. Hence, we contacted New Harvest, a research institute dedicated to the field of cellular agriculture and they connected us with Irfan.
                                    </p>
                                <h3>Implementation</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Irfan shared his views on cultivated meat following our explanation of FGFuture. He made us realize the importance of collaborations between cellular agriculture and traditional farming. Similarly, he mentioned the societies’ negotiation of GMOs and advised us that transparency to the public and farmers can avoid such issues in cultivated meat.  He added that seminars and conferences are the means to educate  society about cultivated meat which was one of the igniting factors for organizing our future farming webinar.

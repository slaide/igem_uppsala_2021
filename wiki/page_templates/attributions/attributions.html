                        New Harvest is a non-profit research institute within the field of cellular agriculture. They are true pioneers, being the first organization to support cultivated meat research and are probably still the most influential to date. We want to thank them for their valuable collaboration throughout the summer. Their support was immensely important for our project‚Äôs visibility and outreach opportunities.

                        Not only did they support us with a number of connections and expert advice throughout our project, but they also provided support leading up to our <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Uppsala/Education#section1_link">Future Farming webinar</a>. Their assistance encouraged us to include a virtual social networking component after presentations for a more informal engagement with attendees. They introduced us to an amazing new virtual world networking solution called Sophya world. This enabled us to host a social networking event, which would not have been possible without the support from New Harvest.

                        <p>
                        We are immensely honored to have been one of the 90 ambitious teams that received the iGEM 2021 Team Impacts Grant. This first-of-its-kind initiative was supported by the Frederick Gardner Cottrell Foundation and provided selected iGEM projects the opportunity to take their project to the next level. Needless to say, the grant has been extremely important to execute our work and we are incredibly grateful that the iGEM association saw the value behind our project.
                        We were proud to be one of the teams which fit the criteria of this grant. We are proud to be one of the teams which tackles climate change, innovative agricultural solutions and even potential reduction of future global pandemics.

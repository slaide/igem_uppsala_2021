                    <p> During the two first weeks of summer the team prepared all upcoming lab work. All necessary solutions were prepared, such as LB, SOB and agar plates with different antibiotics. The team also got the opportunity to practice basic lab techniques under aseptic conditions, which included creating competent cells, streaking and re-streaking agars plates. The lab coordinators also got a more in depth insight in how the waste was supposed to be handels. More details can be found on the page INSERT LINK.

                        <p> During the third week, the real lab work started! The primers had arrived and the team started with the biobrick assembly process. The goal was to create seven different versions of bovine FGF2. Together with our PI, Professor Anthony Forster, and our TA, Konrad Gras, different experiments were designed to create these versions. We cannot  thank Forster and Gras enough for their help with guiding us through these experiments. More details can be found on this page INSERT LINK.

                        <p> When these seven different versions of bovine FGF2 had been created, we had to purify them. First we decided to do it at a small scale in the lab. Here we could troubleshoot and adjust the process for when we were doing an upscaled purification. For more information of the purification results, look HERE INSERT LINK.

                        <p> The team also did a large scale purification at Cytiva Testa Center AB. The team successfully upscaled the purification process of the bovine FGF2 wild type protein. We want to thank Cytiva Testa Center AB for giving us the chance to upscale our project. Thanks to all of the employees and experts working at cytiva for helping us design the experiments and purify the protein. All protocols followed at Cytiva Testa Center AB can be found down below.

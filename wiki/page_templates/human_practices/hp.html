    <p>
        This year, the iGEM Uppsala team was engaged in a Cellular Agriculture related project, a field that is dedicated to the production of slaughter-free lab-grown meat, grown directly from animal cells, otherwise known as cultivated meat.
    </p>

    <h2>
        What is the problem? 
    </h2>
    <p>
        Our planet Earth is currently populated by almost 7.9 billion people with the number rising every second, increasing annually by 1.05% [1]. It is estimated that until 2050 the population will have reached 9.1 billion [2]. Τhis fact does not come without complications, the question of how to feed everyone is being answered with the increase in meat production to 470 million tonnes per year, and the need to diminish world hunger and malnutrition over the world requires an even higher supply of meat [2]. Our current supply food chain and agricultural infrastructures and practices are already compromised in their current state, and in need of more sustainable practices [3][4][5]. They will not be enough to cover our increasing needs [4][5].
    </p>
    <p>
        Cultivated meat has emerged in an attempt to cover these demands without the need to  slaughter animals on a massive scale in order to feed our human population [6] and  will allow more arable land to be freed from animal rearing and to be used for growing crops for human consumption instead [6][7]. Therefore, environmentally speaking, cultivated meat production could lead to a decrease in water consumption and carbon footprint compared to conventional meat production [3][6][7].
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, cultivated meat is considered safe and clean. It does not require the large amounts of antibiotics that are needed in industrial animal farming to prevent infectious diseases in the animals, exacerbating the antibiotic resistance problem we are facing. For cultivated meat, crowded animals in facilities with questionable sanitary conditions will not be necessary [6][7][8]. On that note, animal and human contact will also decrease, potentially preventing the transmission of zoonotic diseases from animals to humans that could lead to future pandemics [7][8]. Cultivated meat might become the answer to many of these problems. 
        For more details, you can see the proposed implementation of our project <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Uppsala/Implementation">here</a> and how it relates to the UN sustainable goals <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Uppsala/Sustainable">here.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        However, the production of cultivated meat is still not completely ideal and it is still quite expensive. In the beginning, the production required the use of Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) as a media supplement. FBS is a serum obtained from calf blood, which contains the necessary growth factors for cell culture proliferation in the lab. Thus, the blood collection procedure that is necessary to obtain FBS renders it not completely animal slaughter-free.[9][10]
    </p>
    <p>
        Commercially engineered growth factors have been, and still are, developed as a substitute for the growth factors found in FBS and are currently available. They are one of the components in so-called serum-free media that substitutes the FBS for the cultivation of the animal cells. The problem is that they are needed in remarkably high quantities due to their lower protein stability, keeping the cost of cultivated meat very high. [9][10][11]
    </p>
    
    <h2>
        Our goal
    </h2>
    <p>
        To get one step closer to the goal of serum free and affordable cultivated meat media, our team aims to improve one of the growth factors required for the process of cultivating meat in the lab. Basic fibroblast growth factor, or FGF2, is a protein with high mitogenic properties. It plays a key role in tissue formation and repairment.[12][13][14]
    </p>
    <p>
        Our team decided to have the upscaling of FGF2 as a project topic this year, to achieve massive production of the basic fibroblast growth factor in bioreactors and in long term its use in industry and the reduction in the cost of cultivated meat production. Inspiration in our goals was the 2014 iGEM SF Bay Area DIYbio team [15], who tried to produce milk-proteins in yeast using synthetic biology. The aforementioned proteins would later be used in the production of vegan milk, with vegan cheese creation as an end goal. Besides that, very few other iGEM teams have tried to delve into the alternative protein sector, and to our knowledge no team so far has presented a project related to cultivated meat, which served as a motivation for our team to pursue this track.
    </p>
    <p>
        To achieve this goal, we pursued several different strategies in our experiments. Our team proceeded with the design and screening of mutations for improving FGF2 using computational tools, site-directed mutagenesis with PCR, and the use of synthetic biology in the generation of optimized mutant FGF2 proteins. In a different approach, a chimeric protein that contains parts from FGF1 and FGF2 (FGFC) was used. This protein was hypothesized to exhibit increased receptor binding affinity, increased stability and thermostability as well as increased solubility for higher yield.
    </p>
    <p>
        The successful achievement of the above objectives would highly impact the industry of cultivated meat and the associated research field, which would forever change our life.

    <h2>
        Short story of our project
    </h2>
    <p>
        Besides dry and wet lab work, our team strived to engage the public in our project ideas and the world of synthetic biology. During the summer, we were mainly responsible for organizing and hosting an online conference. The “Future Farming” webinar covered different topics within the field of cellular and traditional agriculture. We aimed to spread awareness about the development in the cellular agriculture field, and the shortcomings of traditional agriculture that need to be resolved. You can see more details on the Education & Communication page <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Uppsala/Communication">here.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Along with organizing the webinar, our team also hosted a lot of interviews with experts in different scientific fields, one of them being an ethical expert. His advice along with our participation in the SynthEthics workshop that was part of our collaboration with team Stockholm, aided us to better realize the ethical values of our goal and some ethical concerns that might arise from our project. You can see more details on the Ethics part of Human practice <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Uppsala/Human_Practices#ethics">here</a> or Education & Communication <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Uppsala/Communication#synethics_workshop_headline">here.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout the project, we never failed to engage with the general public through our social media pages and platforms, where we always placed great emphasis on valuing their opinions and feedback. We also distributed a survey on cultivated meat as a means to acquire their thoughts on this idea. At the same time, a different farmer survey was launched which was tailored specifically to this target group. Their opinion was of critical importance to us since we consider farmers one of our biggest stakeholders and they are the people who might unintentionally be negatively affected from future implementations of this idea. For more details, you can see the Cultivated meat survey section on the Human Practice or Inclusivity page.

        Ethics
    </h1>
    <div>
        <span>
            In the early stages of our project, we split our human practice team to cover six different categories, each person taking the lead on a specific ethical value surrounding our project. We considered how we could approach our project from the following perspectives:
        </span>
        <ol style="margin-left:0;">
            <li>Environmental - How our project could have good and bad effect on the environment</li>
            <li>Societal - Why is our project needed? How do we combat the increasing demand for meat?</li>
            <li>Ethical - Is it ethically better to consume slaughter-free meat?</li>
            <li>Scepticism - What are the concerns and needs of meat eaters? Why are some skeptical?</li>
            <li>Collaboration - Can we identify others that hope to improve the food system?</li>
            <li>Scientific aspect - What experts could give us an insight into this field?</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p>
        To explore and understand the ethical boundaries of our project, we sought faculty advice on the topic when it comes to ethical implications to consider. In our <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Uppsala/Human_Practices#ihp_expert_interviews_link">expert interview</a> with Stefan Eriksson, Director of the Center for Research Ethics and Bioethics at Uppsala University, we discussed the topic of what ethical meat can be and how people's perception could be similar to the reluctance to GMOs. Although there are no regulations regarding cultivated meat consumption, with the exception of Singapore that recently allowed the consumption of a cultivated meat product [16], it does not seem to be due to health issues occurring from cultivated meat consumption which has neither been verified or refuted due to its novel nature, but because of legislation oversight [17][18]. Before a new product is released into the market it should first be judged as safe by international or domestic organizations such as the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [17][18]. So far the release into the market of two cellular agriculture products (insulin and rennet) has already been approved by FDA [17][18]. However there is a lack of suitable categories under which cultivated meat can be qualified. It is neither a dietary supplement nor a food additive but it also doesn’t meet the criteria for the meat subcategory which according to United States Code (USC) is defined as “the edible part of the muscle of an animal [...] and the portions of bone, skin, sinew, nerve, and blood vessels which normally accompany the muscle tissue and which are not separated from it in the process of dressing” despite meeting the criteria “article used for food or drink for man or other animals [...] ,” that according to Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) place it under the food category [17][18]. If suitable laws for cultivated meat consumption pass, cultivated meat should have a strong ethical argument. We explored a spectrum of topics that varied from considerations of what the benefits are and also where a potentially darker side could emerge.
    </p>
    <p>
        To be prepared for the ethical considerations and problems that might arise due to our project, we attended a workshop with iGEM team Stockholm that is focused on implementing ethics in synthetic biology. The workshop was in collaboration with SynthEthics and they helped us to identify areas where we could take possible actions related to ethics. We considered what would be the optimal outcome of incorporation of cultivated meat in our society and how we could get there.

    <h2>
        The Bright Side
    </h2>
    <p>
        Although our project’s main goal is to optimize the basic growth factor, the long term implementations regarding the production of cultivated meat are connected with animal welfare, indirectly the environment and even our health. Obliquely, our project touches the following ethical considerations:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <div>
            <h3>
                1. Value of animals’ lives
            </h3>
            <p>
                In June 2020, a cattle herd escaped from a local slaughterhouse in Los Angeles, United States [19]. Two of the animals managed to reach safety and avoided the fate of the rest of the escapees which were recaptured and slaughtered. People cheered for the few animals who miraculously enjoyed an hour of freedom and mourned the ones that were killed [19]. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Animals are also living beings and therefore part of the food chain. We humans in particular, have developed special facilities for animal rearing with animal slaughtering for meat consumption as a final result. There are people who consider the practice of killing animals for consumption as natural, that it is man’s rightful dominion upon non-human beings [20], but there are also people who feel uncomfortable and repulsed in the idea and sight of animal death despite enjoying the taste of meat [21][22], a phenomenon called the meat paradox [23]. There are also people who recognize the morality of abstaining from meat consumption to avoid animal killing, even though they eat meat themselves [20].
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a lot of controversy regarding the topic of humans being able to live, and have healthier lives, without meat. It mostly is advertised by vegetarian or vegan proponents, but there are also people who underline the nutritional value and the importance of meat in our diet [20]. Regardless of which side is right or wrong, it is an inevitable fact that people enjoy eating meat. But why do animals need to give their lives for this enjoyment? Cultivated meat offers the chance for people to continue enjoying meat, without any harm done to animals. If we truly had the chance to eliminate animal death while still able to eat meat, would that not be the more moral choice? 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>
                2. Consideration of animal suffering
            </h3>
            <p>
                Sometimes, in order to provide people with more affordable meat, industrial animal farming facilities resort to practices that either disregard or ensure only the bare minimum of animal welfare, rendering animal maintenance more cost-effective [24]. In the current large scale industrial farming facilities, animals suffer all kinds of violent and painful treatments as they are not considered able to feel pain and suffering in the same way as humans do, even though there is a lack of scientific data to support this argument [24][25].
            </p>
            <p>
                Chickens bred for meat with poor locomotion because their legs cannot support their excess weight and female sows confined in very small spaces, to increase the number of animals in the place as well as the protection from other aggressive sows [26], with no room for turning during their pregnancies are only some examples of the harm animals face in large scale industrial farming [24]. The suffering is not limited only to physical abuse. Animals are also sentient beings, they can feel pain and pleasure too [25]. As such, the harmful treatment they are subjected into has a negative impact in their psychology that can be observed through repetitive destructive behaviors such as chewing their cell bars [24]. Therefore a question arises if a practice like cultivated meat production could potentially lead to the abolishment of animal abuse.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>
                3. Consideration for the environment
            </h3>

            <p>
                In all this, one should not forget the environmental consequences. Large scale animal farming consequently leads to the release of harmful substances that pollute the terrestrial and aquatic system [3][7][25]. Greenhouse gases are also emitted, sourced either from the factory facilities or the animals themselves as cows are known to release methane emissions in the atmosphere [3][7][25]. It is argued that it would be more ethical to avoid any practises that harm our planet, which is our home.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>
                4. Consideration for our health
            </h3>
            <p>
                Our health is also a matter of importance. Large scale industrial animal farming is also in some proportion responsible for the exacerbation of many contemporary issues. One of them is the increasing antibiotic resistance that risks rendering the current antibiotics ineffective against pathogens. The need for new, effective antibiotics in such facilities is of utmost importance to reduce the spread of diseases among the captive animals [6][7][8][25].
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite antibiotic usage the spread of diseases between animals still happens, and sometimes those diseases also spread to humans [7][8]. As the current pandemic situation indicates, the danger of zoonotic diseases is always constant and even increased by the growing population of livestock that are enclosed in limited spaces, assisting the spread of pathogens that cause diseases and animal contamination [27]. Furthermore, industrial farm animals that are selected and bred for a specific trait, after some generations they constitute a genetically very similar population that lacks genetic heterogeneity. This means that not only is it less likely for animals that can resist new pathogens to exist in industrial farming livestock but also that new pathogen mutations that can also affect humans are more likely to happen [27][28]. Moreover, the harmful conditions of the farm industry do not contribute to a robust immune system in animals. On the contrary, the suffering that animals are subjected to in industrial animal facilities contributes to weakening of their immune system, rendering them vulnerable to becoming pathogen hosts [27].
            </p>
            <p>
                COVID-19 is not the only pandemic disease that has arisen indirectly due to human exposure to sick animals or meat consumption. There are other previous pandemics throughout history that have arisen because of the above reasons. The swine and avian flu, diseases responsible for pandemics, may have come from one of the outbreaks in industrial farming facilities, and rapidly spread worldwide causing global health problems [29][30]. One should not forget Bovine spongiform encephalopathy that has arisen from cows, commonly known as mad cow disease. Although the last one is responsible only for regional small-scale outbreaks, it is a bright example of the health hazards that meat consumption might lead to [27].
            </p>
            <p>
                Would it not be more ethical to transition into a meat production habit that would also protect us from such harms?
            </p>
        </div>
    </ol>

    <h2>
        The Dark Side
    </h2>

    <p>
        There are also some more malicious aspects of cultivated meat production that could come forward because of our project. There are some major ethical concerns that arise from the establishment of lab grown meat production that consequently bring forward ethical dilemmas.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <div>
            <h3>
                1. Will it negatively impact small scale farmers?
            </h3>
            <p>
                One of the risks of our project is the unintentional repercussions for small scale farmers. For the production of cultivated meat, animal cells need to be donated [3][7] and those can come from animal farms. The main adversary of animal life quality is the industrial factories with unsavory conditions. Small scale farmers with more favorable conditions for animals are considered potential allies and needed for cell donations. However our project’s ideals might be perceived wrongly and it is our responsibility not to let all farmers’ reputations be indiscriminately harmed. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>
                2. Will extinct animals become part of our diet in the future?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Nowadays, since more and more companies and scientists are engaged in the lab-grown production of different kinds of meats such as pork, chicken and fish, the idea of producing unusual kinds of meat might also start circulating. The animal sources for these unusual tastes might be species that are already rendered extinct [6][31]. Genetic material of extinct animals has been found and preserved and with the use of cloning techniques and the donation of stem cells from still existing relative to the extinct species, we could potentially grow cultivated extinct animal meat in bioreactors [32]. There is a certain appeal of tasting meat that has never before been eaten by contemporary humans. With the use of genetic modifications, the possibility to eat mammoth meat or other extinct species could be a possibility [31]. It is already speculated that these kinds of meat are delicious as overhunting was the main reason for the extinction of some of the animals [33]. There are those who advocate that cultivated meat production can pave the way for extinct animals to be brought back to life again; it has already contributed in attempts to create of genetic material reservoirs of current farm animals as well as endangered animal species in case de-extinction is rendered possible in the future [34][35]. It is believed that it is our obligation to revive animal species that became extinct due to human intervention [32]. However there are concerns regarding the consequences of de-extinction as the effects that it may cause to the ecosystems or to other endangered species living in them are unknown [32]. Therefore this point is put more in the morally gray zone.

        <div>
            <h3>
                3. Frankenstein meat 
            </h3>
            <p>
                Despite the numerous arguments in favor of the benefits of cultivated meat related to health, no scientific evidence exists yet that proves the safety of cultivated meat. Since it is a new product still not released in the market, more research information is required. This lack of information concerns a lot of people about potential unknown negative effects or hidden side effects that the consumption of cultivated meat might have on our health [36]. A large percentage of the population is concerned that cultivated meat might be dangerous since they think of it as “unnatural” because it is man-made compared to the “real” conventional meat [37]. There is an ideology that everything natural is inherently good and everything unnatural carries risks, including cultivated meat in the unnatural category [37]. There is even a comment that compares cultivated meat production to the creation of the Frankenstein creature from Mary Shelley’s book [36]. Although the concern arguments are baseless since there is no concrete evidence, the fact remains that we cannot completely guarantee the safety of an untested product.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>
                4. Ethical cannibalism
            </h3>
            <p>
                Many people have expressed their concerns about cellular agriculture leading to the lab production of another more unique taste of meat, that of human flesh [38]. According to cellular agriculture, animals only have to donate their cells for us to enjoy a meat product. Therefore who is to say that in a few years cultivated human meat won’t be the new trend in meat delicacies? Consequently the following dilemma arises: Is it morally wrong to eat human meat? On one hand, the idea of devouring meat from the same species usually leads to feelings of disgust and uneasiness, dividing people due to mistrust. After all, how can you trust someone if you believe that they might want to eat you? On the other hand, although it is considered taboo there are still people in our society, usually not completely mentally healthy, that resort to killing other people for consumption [39]. By providing cultivated human flesh for them some murders might be prevented and no one would get harmed for that reason. Some lives could potentially be saved. And wouldn’t that be morally better compared to killing humans for their flesh?

        Cultivated meat survey
    </h1>
    <p>
        Although cellular agriculture is still a relatively new field, major accomplishments have already been made in it. Among the accomplishments is the production of the first lab grown burger patty by Mark Post in 2013, which was produced from cultured cells [31][40]. Subsequently, the release and commercialization approval of a cultured chicken product was achieved in Singapore in 2020 [41]. In industry, cellular agriculture has majorly developed in a short time. In the last few years, a lot of companies and non-profit organizations have arisen all over the world that are dedicated to the production of other cultured meat products such as cultivated pork and chicken meat, cultivated fish and even leather [42]. However, despite cultivated meat being a reality for a couple of years now, people are either unfamiliar with it or reluctant to try it, as they find it unpleasant. In order to raise awareness of the development of cultivated meat and to assess people’s willingness to accept cultivated meat in their everyday life, our team created and distributed an online survey to the general public. Below you can see some of the comments left by people who took the survey as well as our survey questions.

        <h3 style="margin-top:0;">Facts about cultivated meat:</h3>
        <p>
            Scientists are working on a new method of producing meat by using animal cells instead of living animals. Cells are grown in a tank to form and produce muscle tissue, which is the main component of the traditional meat we know today. Harvesting meat in such a way is called "cultivated meat". This will likely be widely available within the next decade. Note that it is real animal meat and should not be confused with current plant-based meat substitutes on the market.
        </p>
        <div style="margin-left:2.5vh;">
            Cultivated meat would be free from:
            <ul>
                <li>Overuse of antibiotics in meat production</li>
                <li>The risk of zoonotic diseases</li>
                <li>The cruelty of slaughtering animals</li>
                <li>Severe environmental impacts of current industrial agriculture system</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p style="padding-bottom:0;">
            Several products that we know today have been enabled with the help of biotechnology through various organisms in culture tanks, this includes many fermentation products like cheese, yogurt, beer, wine and bread. Cultivated meat would be yet another innovative food product on the market added to the list.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        We inquired about their expectations from cultivated meat and the reasons that would motivate and hinder them to try cultivated meat. We also received their opinions on cultivated meat impacting traditional livestock farming.

    <h2>
        People's response and thoughts about cellular agriculture
    </h2>
    <div class="slideshow-container wide" id="cellular_agriculture_responses">
        <div class="mySlide">
            I think in order to restore a balance in the biosystem and to fulfill the demands of the growing population changes such as cultivated meat need to be undertaken.
        </div>
        <div class="mySlide">
            Cultivated meat will definitely be a great solution in bringing down the environmental impact and also reduce animal slaughtering. The idea of increasing production in order to reduce costs seems very interesting and appreciable.
        </div>
        <div class="mySlide">
            Looking forward to the success of these projects. Innovative. Guilt-free protein food without killing animals.
        </div>
        <div class="mySlide">
            I think cultivated meat will be a blessing for both Human beings and animals.
        </div>
        <div class="mySlide">
            Please hurry up your experiments. I've been waiting for this since the first time I heard about it in 2014 and I really think it’s a good solution to feed the earth’s growing population. I think many people in the world will starve without this because we won’t have enough land to grow crops on for the amount of people in the world in the future.
        </div>
        <div class="mySlide">
            I think it's a great innovation. I primarily try to reduce my meat intake because of environmental reasons. I hope that a switch to cultivated meat results in a (large) reduction of CO2 emissions and water usage. I also hope that it will not be sold in plastic packaging.
        </div>
        <div class="mySlide">
            I don't have a great knowledge about cultivated meat but I would like to give it a try. This survey induced a curiosity which triggered me to try cultivated meat in future.

    <h2>
        Concerns about cellular agriculture imposing on agriculture and farmers:
    </h2>
    <p>
        Similar to our concerns about traditional farming practices and farmers' employability ,our respondents also raised queries as below. These comments further influenced us to get to know more about farmers' opinions on this field:
    </p>
    <div class="slideshow-container wide" id="cellular_agriculture_concerns">
        <div class="mySlide">
            Farmers would need to be educated towards producing the cultivated meat to allow for a smooth transition and having public's support.
        </div>
        <div class="mySlide">
            Cultivated meat will undoubtedly disrupt conventional livestock farming. Provided we can reduce operating costs and educate farmers, to diversify into more sustainable practises, it presents an exciting opportunity to develop sustainable meat production.
        </div>
        <div class="mySlide">
            Farmers in the traditional business should have a smooth transition into the cultivated meat process.

                The production of cultivated meat will be performed in sterilized environments similar to that of pharma industries which can prevent possible contamination from zoonotic pathogens. We are concerned about farmers too and engaged in hearing their opinions on cultivated meat production.

                I think the biggest obstacle for cultivated meat to go mainstream would be the public opinion on bioengineered food products. GMOs already are facing a lot of flak, especially in my country. I'd be willing to try it because I understand the science behind it, even if it's only a little bit. But there's a lot of people who don't really trust these things, and getting them to do so would be the main challenge here.

            <div class="conversation_right">
                This question can be answered by illustrating an example of beyond burger and its potential of being ranked as one of the most successful IPOs (Initial Public Offering) in the last decade.This concludes that people are interested in investing and in addition by holding hands with food chains like McDonalds, Burger king and many more it is possible to reach public.

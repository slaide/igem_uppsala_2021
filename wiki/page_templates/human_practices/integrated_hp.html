    <h1> Our Story </h1>

    <h2> Our pre-project work: </h2>
    <p>
    FGFuture started when students from 11 different programs, all around the world at different stages of their education joined together with the aim of creating a positive impact on this planet.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before officially starting , we discussed facts and aspects of synthetic biology which motivated us to join this year’s iGEM competition. Because we come from different academic backgrounds, we had different motivations on why we wanted to be a part of  the team but everyone’s ultimate goal was to learn something new and exciting. We started by discussing what could be the potential impact of synthetic biology in the future. Then we went through the details about iGEM in-depth and were astonished by earlier projects which eventually made us pitch project ideas of our own.
    </p>

        <p>Figure 1:  A visual description of the brainstorming sessions for project idea generation.</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Initially, we submitted each idea and ended up with a pool of twenty five diverse ideas. We then pitched the ideas to each other and selected five of them. Following that, we divided ourselves into five  groups to discuss the theory behind implementing those five ideas and made a final decision on choosing FGFuture as our project. We tried to implement the human practice component in every stage of our project, including the selection process. To illustrate that, we thoroughly went through the SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis to analyze the feasibility of each project. We voted for project ideas considering the sustainable goals and how they may impact the world. Although there were many great ideas, we wanted to explore the cellular agriculture field which drove us to choose a project related to improvement of cultivated meat production.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Understanding the problem:</h2>
    <p>
        After selecting our project, we explored how cellular agriculture is beneficial and can help the food industry. Talking about food, we cannot forget the famous quote by M.F.K Fisher <b> <i> “First we eat and then we do everything else” </b> </i>.Who doesn’t love food? Every single one of us has to eat every day to survive, as food is a vital ingredient for a happy and healthy life. During one of the discussions, a question arose, “Is our current food chain sustainable? Let’s talk about reality”. With that, we walked through the disadvantages of the current livestock farming: including zoonotic diseases, antibiotic resistance, animal welfare, greenhouse gas emissions, land and water use.This aspect was shocking and motivated us to think about the long-term consequences that could emerge if we continue to neglect these problems. One concern was that we cannot feed the human population with the current available resources and actions have to be taken regarding the aforementioned  disadvantages. That eventually led us to the path of “sustainability without sacrifice” using cellular agriculture.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Exploring current cultivated meat production:</h2>
    <p>
        Meat substitutes are not novel products. Mosa meat, Memphis meat and other cellular agriculture companies have already paved the way [1]. That made us question why cultivated meat is not commercially available yet. What are the bottlenecks that are limiting progress? We searched for an answer in published articles and concluded the three important factors that need to be considered and solved: Cost, Scale-up, and regulation [2].  The next step was to pick one limiting factor and try to solve it. Firstly, we found ourselves concerned with the cost;we wanted to make cultivated meat affordable for the average consumer. Diving deeper, we found out that it was the growth factors used to replace Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) in growth media that kept the cost high [3]. We studied the different growth factors used for the cultivated meat production: EGF, IGF1, VEGF, FGF2, FN, KGF, TGF-beta and Serum Albumin. Out of all, we decided to improve and optimize the Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGFs) because it is one of the most expensive components of serum free media and also  has a simpler structure to work with. Apart from the lab work, we wanted to integrate human practice at every step of our project by considering things outside of the lab. This gravitated us to have an expert interview with Professor Carl Heldin Henrik who is the mastermind behind the research projects on growth factors at Uppsala university.
    </p>
    <p>
        Carl Henrik walked us through the optimization techniques for growth factors which was very insightful for our project. In addition to the techniques, Carl-Henrik Heldin mentioned the ethical issues regarding cultivated meat production which encouraged us to contact Stefan Eriksson, director of the Center for Research Ethics and Bioethics. Eriksson supported our project by mentioning that <i> “if the need arises people will consider changing their food habits”</i>.
    </p>
    
    <h2>How synthetic biology can help to feed the world?</h2>
    <p>
        After discussing the optimization techniques, we decided to proceed with three different approaches in the wet lab. But first, we wanted answers for queries related to cell culture, to make sure that the project was feasible.Therefore we approached Elin Sjöberg, a researcher with experience in cell culture, to get her perception of our project. The interviews so far led us to believe in synthetic biology and its potential to reduce world hunger.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Implementation: </h2>
    <p>
        Being an interdisciplinary team has many advantages. It enabled us to think about in silico approaches before starting any experiments in the wet lab. The modeling team communicated with the researcher Henning Henschel to get an idea about softwares that can be useful for our computational techniques. In addition, we were fortunate enough to get in touch with professor Hugo Gutierrez de Teran from the department of cell and molecular biology. He helped us with software called ‘Q’ to view the effects of different mutations on structural stability before implementing any wet-lab experiments. Apart from modeling, we received guidance and useful advice from Professor Anthony Foster throughout our project who assisted us to kick start our wet lab work.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>Cultivated meat production chain:</h2>
    <p>
        Apart from the lab, we wanted to go through the cultivated meat production supply chain to learn about different stages of the process. As a consequence, we realized the importance of the general public, as they are the ultimate consumers of many products. That realization influenced us to know more about people’s perception of our project and cultivated meat in general. After all, we wanted to know whether our project will be a success in the market. Thus, through our human practice subteam we framed a survey that we first distributed to our team. To our surprise, we received different opinions from such a small group of people which prompted us to come up with  the ‘Cultivated meat survey’. Even though there are few available surveys around this subject we wanted to compare and contrast those with ours. After the first responses we received, we realized that there is a need to spread awareness on cellular agriculture.That’s where the idea of <i> Cell Ag monday </i> stemmed from, to showcase the concept behind cellular agriculture in our social media platform as an educational content.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Who can be impacted by our project?</h2>
    <p>
        The survey then motivated us to examine the impact that our project may have in the near future which made us inquire experts from the cellular agriculture field. Irfan Tahir, a researcher at New Harvest, gave us advice about who can be affected both positively and negatively by large scale production of cultivated meat. He talked mainly about farmers’ inclusivity as they are the backbone of our society.For this reason, we created a specialized survey for farmers along with iGEM Maastricht to learn their valuable opinions on our projects.Inclusivity of farmer’s perspective in our project was inspired by few factors which firstly includes our expert interview with Stefan Eriksson as he mentioned that it could be debated how farmers would be affected.Also,our general public survey results showed that people were concerned about profession of farmers.Ultimately, we were inspired by interview with Abi Aspen Glencross back in 2016, in which she shared her strong thoughts on inclusivity of farmers in the conversation of integrating cellular agriculture into the future farming.It will be a combination of multiple factors that will allow us to reach a more sustainable future and we believe farmers should be a part of the conversation.Other than the survey, we created Farmers’ Friday posts on social media,Through these efforts to connect with farmers, we  aimed to find out how solutions developed by both sides could contribute to the transition from  current agricultural methods that can benefit both farmers and the cultivated meat industry.
    </p>
    
    <h2> Cultivated meat is a sensitive topic: </h2>
    <p>
        We reached out to companies for sponsorships which made us recognize that cultivated meat is a sensitive topic.For that, we brainstormed as a team to present our project effectively to sponsors as well as to the public and that’s when Drivhuset made its appearance. They helped us on how to communicate our project through a workshop organized by us in collaboration with iGEM Stockholm.Their guidance helped us to confidently pitch our project to companies like Pan biotech and CellulaREvolution who were interested in our mutated FGF2.
    </p>
    
    <h2> Is FGFuture a revolution in cultivated meat?: </h2>
    <p>
        Besides wet lab work, we conducted brainstorming sessions every week. In one of these sessions we started debating a few questions which directed us to patenting issues. Some of those questions were: “What if our project is really successful? If so, do we want to patent our mutation? Is that possible?”. The human practice team approached Kerstin Ekelöf  from Uppsala University Innovation office, a facility where students and researchers can get support for patenting and commercialization of their ideas. She helped us understand and resolve our uncertainty around patents in research.
    </p> 
    
    <h2> Upscaling our project: </h2>
    <p>
        While approaching the end of our lab experiments, we talked about the plans and ideas to upgrade our project to the next level. While talking about upgrades, we started dreaming about the upscaling of FGFuture. Few of our team members had a virtual tour of Testa Centre, a pilot scale biological production unit in their program. With the help of our coordinator Magareta Krabbe we got an opportunity to discuss our upscaling idea with Adam Wegelius, Jesper Hedberg, Jens Hammarlund, Charlotte Brink and over at Testa Center and our supervisor from Uppsala University Chandra Sekhar Mandava. We were excited and happy to make our vision happen by conducting actual upscaling experiments in testa. This resulted in the team’s exploration of another bottleneck of cultivated meat which is upscaling of production. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>FGFuture in the market:</h2>
    <p>
        Our dreams about FGFuture does not stop there, we wondered and wanted to be certain that our project will reach the community. At the same time we came across a <a href="https://www.ikigailaw.com/overview-regulatory-issues-surrounding-cultivated-meat/#acceptLicense">blog</a> post about regulations on cultivated meat which influenced us to consider another problem in cultivated meat production, the regulations. Therefore, we received advice from an indian law firm, Ikigai law, who then connected us with Good food institute, India. In addition to that, we organized the <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Uppsala/Communication#webinar_link">Future farming webinar</a> with an ideal lineup of  speakers to spread awareness about the interesting cellular agriculture field.
    </p>
    <br>
    
    <p>Our love and dream for FGFuture continues!</p>

We began the discussion with general questions regarding patenting which includes cost and the amount of time one can have the patent. After that, she assisted us by explaining what could be patented and the route for patenting in our project. Finally, she highlighted the importance of protecting our findings since that, for example, would make it more attractive to external parties and investors’ and much more.",

As the food authority of Singapore has <a href='https://gfi.org/blog/cultivated-meat-singapore/'>accepted cultivated chicken,</a> we were eager to know the acceptance level of different authorities around the world and we believed that Ikigai law can be a productive resource in that matter.",

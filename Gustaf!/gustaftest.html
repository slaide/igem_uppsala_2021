        <h2><p style="color:red;">Ingredients</h2>

        <p>1 cup all purpose flour </p> 
        <p>2 tablespoons of sugar</p>
        <p>2 teaspoons baking powder</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>1 cup of milk</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons of melted unsalted butter</p>

        <hr>

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">Instructions</h2>

        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Preheat oven to <b> 200 Fahrenheit </b>; 
            have a baking sheet or heatproof platter ready to keep cooked 
            pancakes warm in the oven.
            In a small bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, 
            baking powder, and salt; set aside.
        </p>

        <h3> Step 2</h3>
        <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, butter, and egg. Add dry ingredients to milk mixture;
             whisk until just moistened 
            <i>(do not overmix; a few small lumps are fine)</i></p>

        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Heat a large skillet (nonstick or cast-iron) or griddle over medium. 
            Fold a sheet of paper towel in half, and moisten with oil; 
            carefully rub skillet with oiled paper towel.</p>

        <h3> Step 4</h3>

        <p>For each pancake, spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter onto skillet,
             using the back of the spoon to spread batter into a round
             <small> (you should be able to fit 2 to 3 in a large skillet).</small></p>
             

        <h3> Step 5</h3>
        <p>Cook until surface of pancakes have some bubbles and a few have burst, 1 to 2 minutes.
             Flip carefully with a thin spatula, and cook until browned on the underside, 1 to 2 minutes more.
              Transfer to a baking sheet or platter; cover loosely with aluminum foil, and keep warm in oven. 
              Continue with more oil and remaining batter. (You'll have 12 to 15 pancakes.) 
            Serve warm, with desired toppings.</p>
